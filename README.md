# DB-With-GUI

This is an application that was created for a school project to show the capability of creating a GUI app that is connected to a fully functioning self-contained database.

The startup project after downloading and unzipping the project should be CustomerGUI.

All of the data inside is just sample data but has full CRUD capability. 

A similar application can be made for any number of businesses with whatever functionality is desired. 

Hope you enjoy the project!
